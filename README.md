# Hospital Management Data Analysis Project
##### By: Roshan Nikam
### 1. Introduction
This project focuses on analysing hospital operations using data from various departments
including doctors, patients, appointments, billing, and treatments. The goal was to process,
query, and visualize the data to uncover actionable insights to support healthcare decisions
and improve hospital efficiency.

### 2. Project Objectives
Import and manage hospital data using PostgreSQL (pgAdmin).
Execute complex SQL queries for data analysis.
Visualize the queries and KPIs using Power BI and Python.
Build an interactive dashboard for quick decision-making.
Identify patterns, inefficiencies, and revenue metrics.

### 3. Tools & Technologies Used
Tool Purpose
pgAdmin Data storage, SQL queries
Power BI Dashboards, data visualization
Python Data cleaning, advanced charts
Pandas SQL processing in Python
Seaborn/Matplotlib Data plots

### 4. Dataset Overview
worked with 5 datasets in CSV format:
File Name
doctors.csv
patients.csv
appointments.csv
billing.csv
treatment.csv

### 5. Data Preparation and Import
CSV files were imported into PostgreSQL using pgAdmin.
Tables were cleaned and relationships were created using foreign keys (e.g., patient ID in billing linked to patients).
Data types were cast properly (dates, numeric fields, etc.).
Null values were handled during import.
Added new columns and created measures in powerbi

### 6. SQL Querying using pgAdmin
Performed SQL analysis using PostgreSQL. Key queries included:
Total appointments were made per doctor
patients have the highest number of appointments
trend of appointments over the last 12 months
How many appointments were completed, cancelled, or pending
total billing amount generated per month
doctor generates the most revenue
average billing amount per treatment type
percentage of billing is overdue or unpaid
patients received each type of treatment
average cost associated with each treatment
revenue by each treatment
doctors have the highest number of appointments
average appointment time per doctor
revenue generated by each doctor
do patients revisit the hospital
percentage of patients have multiple treatments
seasonal patterns in patient visits or treatments

### Example Query:
SELECT d.name AS doctor_name, COUNT(a.appointment_id) AS total_appointments
FROM appointments a
JOIN doctors d ON a.doctor_id = d.doctor_id
GROUP BY d.name;

### 7. Power BI Dashboard
Imported SQL data into Power BI.
Created dynamic and interactive dashboards with slicers for:
   o Reason for visit
   o Treatment type
#### Power BI Visuals:
Bar Chart: doctors attended patients
Line Chart: Monthly appointments
Pie Chart: Payment Status
Donut chart: Appointment status
Table: Patient revisit
Total revenue
Total patients
Gender distribution

### 8. Python Visualizations
Used Python to create additional insights and visualizations using Pandas, Matplotlib, and
Seaborn.
Visuals Created:
Bar plot’s
Pie chart
Tables
line graph
#### Example Python Code:
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
query1=””” SELECT d.name AS doctor_name, COUNT(a.appointment_id) AS
total_appointments
FROM appointments a
JOIN doctors d ON a.doctor_id = d.doctor_id
GROUP BY d.name;”””
df = pd.read_sql("query1, engine")
sns.barplot(data=df, x='department', y='total_charges')
plt.title("Billing Charges by Department")
plt.show()

### 9. Key Insights & Results
Highest patient traffic is in the Chemotherapy and X-Ray treatment.
25% Appointment Cancelled
Doctor Dr. Sarah Taylor had the highest number of patients.
Quarter two of the year and first month had peak appointment bookings.
34% billing amount pending and 33% bill failed.
Generated most revenue in first month.
16-time one patient took appointments.
Generated most revenue in MRI treatment type.
38 % received payment by credit card
10-time one patient visited to hospital.

### 11. Conclusion
The project effectively demonstrated how hospital data can be transformed into insights
through SQL, Power BI, and Python. The dashboards and visualizations provide a useful
analytical tool for hospital administrators to monitor operations and improve service
delivery.
